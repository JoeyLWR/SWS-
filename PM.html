                Silkscreen printing (also known as screen printing) is one of the most 
                common and cheaper process of printing of which images are printed to t shirts.
                A desired custom t shirt design will be imposed on the 
                silkscreen with the empty areas coated with impermeable solution. <br> 
                Ink is then forced through the screen on to the apparels or tee shirts 
                forming the image desired printed.
                This method of printing is suitable for solid colour and it is cost 
                effective for lesser colour prints.<br>
                Each colour of print require a new 
                exposure to the silkscreen, therefore every mold will require a startup cost.<br>
                To reduce cost of t shirt printing, customers should look at <br>
                reducing the number of colours used in designs or increase the 
                quantity purchased.

            <!-- Embroidery Text-->
                Embroidery is the use of threads that is stitched to the customized 
                image of a tee shirt.
                This method allows single, multicolours or gradient printing. <br> 
                With embroidery, it creates a professional image and look of a 
                particular organisation.  
                Company often choose cotton polo t shirts to go with it.
                Embroidery print also have its limitation such as unable to print too 
                fine words due to small threads of stitches.
                However, unlike silkscreen printing, embroidery do not have a 
                start of cost to print but cost will be reduced with 
                higher quantity of apparels or <br>t-shirt chosen.
            <br>

            Vinyl/transfer printing as its name clearly shown that it is the use of  
            heat, transferring a material to a t-shirt. <br>
            This method of print (vinyl heat transfer) is often  
            used for jerseys whereby the back of the shirts are individual names and numbers.  <br> 
            It is also used for t shirt that have multicolour logos or logos with gradient colours.
            Unlike silkscreen print, heat transfer printing does not have a startup cost,
            so cost are not directly affected by quantity but the printing size of the image 
            to teeshirts. <br>

            able to do it with low cost and high quality.<br>
